# Be a switch

Understanding the basic concepts of an ethernet switch can be challenging in the beginning. All the new technical terms, IEEE industry standards names and CLI configuration can easily overwhelm a young networker. 

This application is a draft for a concept where the user learns how a switch works by making the switching decisions himself. 
The user is prompted one ethernet frame after another. For each those he decides on which ports the frames should be sent. He learns by try-and-error. When he reaches a 100% success rate, he’s able to “think like a switch”. 

This current available version focuses on VLANs and is shipped as a Windows WPF application. Long term goal is to develop a lightweight WebApp. 
Feel free to use this application for your class or self-studying.
Feedback is welcome!
